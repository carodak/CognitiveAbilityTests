# Cognitive Ability Test
 >Series of cognitive exercises done in Javascript, HTML and CSS during my thesis project.
 
I researched different types of existing cognitive exercises and developed them in Javascript, HTML and CSS.

5 series of cognitive exercises have been implemented with 4 levels of difficulty:

- abstract and spatial reasoning
- critical thinking
- spatial orientation
- spatial memory
- working memory

This version of the program is a first test prototype that includes short samples of known tests (Raven Matrices, GMat, WMAS IV, WAIS IV). The purpose here is to test the developed interface. The logical step would be to create new similar exercises.
