# Cognitive Ability Test
 >Series of cognitive exercises done in Javascript, HTML and CSS during my thesis project.
 
I researched different types of existing cognitive exercises and implemented them in Javascript, HTML and CSS.

5 series of cognitive exercises have been implemented with 4 levels of difficulty:

- abstract and spatial reasoning
- critical thinking
- spatial orientation
- spatial memory
- working memory

This version of the program is a first test prototype that includes short samples of known tests (Raven Matrices, GMat, WMAS IV, WAIS IV).
